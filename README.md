Project Work
Below is a simple summary of each Project

-Time Series Forecast:
  Using R studios, I imported a dataset covering pollution levels over the span of decades. Then I removed linear trends and created a stationary model. Afterwards, I built and compared many SARIMA models by AIC to find the most accurate model to fit using training data. Then analyzed the training data with the test data. 
  

-Poverty Machine Learning Project
Using the education dataset in R, I created and tested numerous Machine Learning Models, as well as Dimensionality Reduction using PCAs and evaluating variable significance. The ML models include Decision Trees, Boosting, GLMs. Then looking at results with Confusion Matrix and enhancing models with Cross Validation. 

-Character Recognition
Following ML course online, I created a Sequential LSTM model that trained over 1000s of alphabet character images to learn patterns present in any given character, so when some character image is input, the model will predict which letter is actually being inputed. 

-Stock Analysis
Created Sequential LSTM model to train over years of Apple Stock Data to predict closing stock price on any given day.
